# DockEnum

## What is it ?

DockEnum is a little bash script made to check some ways to escape and breakout from a Docker container.

It checks some things :

* The running environment
* If the privileged mode is enabled
* What capabilities are available to breakout the container

## Who to use it ?

Very easy ! Copy/paste or download the **DockEnum.sh** script to the container and run it like that :

```bash
chmod +x DockEnum.sh
./DockEnum.sh
```

And that all !
